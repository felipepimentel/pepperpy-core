Overview
========

Introduction
-----------

PepperPy Core is a modern Python framework designed to simplify the development of robust and scalable applications.
It provides a comprehensive set of tools and utilities for building maintainable software.

Key Features
-----------

Event System
~~~~~~~~~~~

The event system enables loose coupling between components through a publish-subscribe pattern.
Events can be synchronous or asynchronous, with support for prioritization and error handling.

Plugin System
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A flexible plugin architecture allows for easy extension of application functionality.
Plugins can be loaded dynamically and are managed through a centralized registry.

Task Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Robust task management capabilities for handling background jobs, scheduled tasks,
and long-running processes with proper lifecycle management.

Type Safety
~~~~~~~~~~

Built with type safety in mind, leveraging Python's type hints and static type checking
to catch errors early and improve code maintainability.

Architecture
-----------

Core Components
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Event System: Handles event dispatching and subscription
- Plugin System: Manages plugin lifecycle and dependencies
- Task Management: Coordinates background tasks and processes
- Registry: Centralized component management
- Security: Access control and validation
- Logging: Structured logging with context
- Configuration: Environment-aware settings
- Cache: In-memory and persistent caching
- Serialization: Data format conversion
- Validation: Input validation and sanitization

Design Principles
----------------

1. Type Safety: Comprehensive type hints and static checking
2. Modularity: Loosely coupled components with clear interfaces
3. Extensibility: Easy to extend through plugins and events
4. Performance: Optimized for both speed and resource usage
5. Security: Built-in security features and best practices
6. Testing: Highly testable with comprehensive test utilities
7. Documentation: Clear and up-to-date documentation
8. Standards: Follows Python best practices and PEPs

Best Practices
-------------

1. Use type hints consistently
2. Handle errors gracefully
3. Write comprehensive tests
4. Document public APIs
5. Follow security guidelines
6. Keep components focused
7. Use async where appropriate
8. Maintain clean architecture

Getting Started
--------------

1. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install pepperpy-core
   ```

2. Import required components:
   ```python
   from pepperpy import Registry, Event, Plugin
   ```

3. Configure your application:
   ```python
   registry = Registry()
   registry.initialize()
   ```

4. Start building your application with PepperPy Core!
